## ⚙️ Tools I Use

### 📝 Neovim (with LazyVim)
My primary editor, supercharged with [LazyVim](https://www.lazyvim.org/) – a modular Neovim config powered by lazy-loading plugins for speed and simplicity. It's my go-to for writing code, markdown, and everything in between.

### 📊 lazygit
A lightweight terminal UI for Git. I use lazygit to stage, commit, rebase, and push code quickly without ever leaving the terminal. Git just feels better with it.

### 📁 yazi
A blazing fast terminal file manager written in Rust 🚀. Think of it like a modern `nnn` or `ranger` – sleek, customizable, and productivity-focused.

### 🌌 starship
My minimal, blazing-fast, and highly customizable shell prompt. Works across shells and displays contextual info beautifully. Keeps my terminal aesthetic clean and informative.

### 🖥️ ghostty
A modern GPU-accelerated terminal emulator. Fast, beautiful, and built with developer ergonomics in mind. It fits right into my workflow with performance and polish.
