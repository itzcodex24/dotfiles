## 📦 Overview

Welcome to my dotfiles! These configuration files power and personalize my development environment. Managed seamlessly with [chezmoi](https://www.chezmoi.io/) 🏠, this repo is the single source of truth for my terminal, editor, and CLI tools.

> ⚠️ **Work in Progress**: Constantly evolving as I tweak, experiment, and optimize my workflow.

## ⚙️ Tools I Use

### 📝 Neovim (with LazyVim)
My primary editor, supercharged with [LazyVim](https://www.lazyvim.org/) – a modular, lazy-loading plugin manager that keeps Neovim snappy and modern. Ideal for both coding and quick notes.

### 🧰 tmux
My terminal multiplexer of choice – [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux) allows me to manage multiple terminal sessions efficiently. Paired with sensible keybindings and plugins for a seamless workflow across panes and windows.

### 💻 zsh
My preferred shell, powered by a curated plugin ecosystem and theming via [starship](https://starship.rs/). It provides intelligent autosuggestions, syntax highlighting, and a rich interactive experience.

### 📊 lazygit
A simple, fast, and powerful terminal UI for Git. I use it to manage commits, branches, and merge conflicts with ease – without leaving the terminal.

### 📁 yazi
A modern, Rust-based terminal file manager – sleek, responsive, and packed with features. A joy to use compared to traditional alternatives.

### 🌌 starship
My shell prompt of choice – minimal, blazing-fast, and beautifully informative. Custom-tailored to show exactly what I need: Git status, language version, and more.

### 🖥️ ghostty
A GPU-accelerated terminal emulator that's fast, beautiful, and built with developer ergonomics in mind. Smooth rendering and high performance make it a key part of my daily workflow.

### 🍞 bun
A modern JavaScript runtime like Node.js, but faster and more efficient. I use [bun](https://bun.sh/) for running scripts, managing packages, and building JS/TS projects at lightning speed.

### 🍺 Homebrew
The missing package manager for macOS (and Linux). I use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) to install and manage CLI tools, fonts, and GUI apps. It keeps my system tidy and my tools up-to-date.
